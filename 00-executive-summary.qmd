# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

The Performance Section of the Brazilian Department of Airspace Control and the Performance Review Unit of EUROCONTROL jointly developed this third edition of the Brazil-Europe comparison of Air Navigation System Performance. 
This edition of the bi-regional report builds on the previous comparison reports using commonly agreed metrics and definitions to compare, understand, and improve the performance of air navigation services. 
This report and previous editions are available at

This report revises the assessment of both the Brazilian and European air navigation systems, extending the time frame and incorporating additional analyses. 
The report focuses on a subset of the eleven Key Performance Areas identified by the ICAO Global Air Navigation Plan. 
The focus of this report is on operational air navigation system performance, in particular Predictability, Capacity and Efficiency.

The comparison shows similarities and differences in the air navigation service provision and observed performance in both regions. Major take-aways of this report include:

-   The close collaboration between DECEA and EUROCONTROL is highlighted sharing insights and experiences with the international aviation communities, thus assisting in advancing ATM performance management worldwide.
-   Brazil saw a rise in the ATCOs number, whereas Europe observed a considerable decrease, highlighting a substantial contrast in the systems' responsiveness to the challenges of COVID/re-emerging demand for air traffic.
-   In 2022, the commercial flight distribution reveals that a smaller number of airports manage 80% of commercial takeoffs, with Brazil showing a slightly greater concentration compared to Europe. <!-- that sounds weird: Nevertheless, the majority of airports facilitating commercial flights account for only 1% of the total movement in both systems. -->
-   Regarding punctuality, unique trends were evident in both regions, not solely attributable to the extent of traffic resurgence. In Brazil, a consistently higher proportion of flights arrived significantly early, a pattern largely unaffected when comparing 2019 to 2022. Conversely, the documented challenges of European airports in coping with the recovering traffic demand in 2022 highlighted the repercussions of their lower preparedness levels.
-   The recorded throughput at Brazilian airports exhibited less variability amid the pandemic, indicating a sustained demand concentration during peak operational hours. In the European context, innovative operational ideas present the most substantial potential for growth, considering the existing runway systems and associated capacities, which set an upper limit.
-   The fresh dataset for Brazil reaffirmed past patterns regarding the extra time spent in terminal airspace. Typically, arrival sequencing and limited capacity lead to extended times during the arrival phase. In Europe, reduced air traffic translated to less strain on arrival sequencing. Yet, the notable rise from 2021 to 2022 in multiple airports implies that constraints and heightened sequencing might resurface as demand increases.

<!-- last edition findings 
• The difference between Brazil’s and Europe’s systems reacting to the seasons became
more evident during the pandemic recovery. When not hit by another COVID-19
wave, the European region had greater variations in demand between the winter
and summer seasons. The Brazilian flow recovered more gradually, showing a more
continuous demand.
• Predictability in both systems degraded during and post COVID phase and is slowly
recovering to pre-COVID-19 levels.
• Airport runway system capacities in both systems are designed to meet the traffic
levels. Capacities at the Brazilian airports were increased in light of a change of
methodology to determine these capacities and changed procedures.
• The European system showed a higher association between lower demand and
increased efficiency considering additional taxi time, additional time in terminal
airspace and flight time variability. Taxi performance in Brazil follows similar
principles and operational procedures with no significant differences. The partial
analysis of additional time in terminal airspace revealed that on average traffic
in Brazil observed higher times during the arrival phase in 2021 suggesting a
system-wide change. The level of variability of flight times reflected the overall
trend.
• An initial approach to quantifying the emission benefit pool on the basis of the
observed additional taxi-times was developed. Emissions and the improvement pool
- next to operational constraints and inefficiencies - are dependent on the fleet mix
operated at the different airports. This includes the role of the airport within the
respective system. Larger hubs with a higher share of traffic - and in particular
heavy aircraft operations - showed a higher contribution to the overall emission
benefit pool.

This report will be updated throughout the coming years under the umbrella of the DECEA-EUROCONTROL memorandum of cooperation. It is also planned to establish a web-based rolling monitoring updated on a regular basis.

Future editions will complement the data time series and support the development of further use-case analyses. The lessons learnt of this joint project will be coordinated with the multi-national Performance Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) and the ICAO GANP Study sub-group concerned with the further development of the GANP Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
