# Next chapter

This placeholder chapter is used to practice the git workflow. 

As a reminder: we can always toggle between the `docs` folder that is used to serve the site and the **internal** (local testing) by switching the output-dir in `_quarto.yml` to `_books`.

We can mock around with it without impacting the exising material.

The workflow will be to update chapter by chapter - and use this for experimental purposes. In the end we simply delete / remove this file.
