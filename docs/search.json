    "text": "The Performance Section of the Brazilian Department of Airspace Control and the Performance Review Unit of EUROCONTROL jointly developed this fourth edition of the Brazil-Europe comparison of Air Navigation System Performance. This edition of the bi-regional report builds on the previous comparison reports using commonly agreed metrics and definitions to compare, understand, and improve the performance of air navigation services. This report and previous editions are available at * https://ansperformance.eu/global/brazil or * https://performance.decea.mil.br/.\nThis report revises the assessment of both the Brazilian and European air navigation systems, extending the time frame and incorporating additional analyses. :::{callout-note} such as point merge system and a short Curitiba and Lisbon ACC comparison ::: The report focuses on a subset of the eleven Key Performance Areas identified by the ICAO Global Air Navigation Plan. The focus of this report is on operational air navigation system performance, in particular Predictability, Capacity and Efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Key Performance Areas addressed in this edition\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comparison shows similarities and differences in the air navigation service provision and observed performance in both regions. Major take-aways of this report include:\n\nThe close collaboration between DECEA and EUROCONTROL is highlighted sharing insights and experiences with the international aviation communities, thus assisting in advancing ATM performance management worldwide.\nBrazil saw a rise in the ATCOs number, whereas Europe observed a considerable decrease, highlighting a substantial contrast in the systems’ responsiveness to the challenges of COVID/re-emerging demand for air traffic.\nIn 2022, the commercial flight distribution reveals that a smaller number of airports manage 80% of commercial takeoffs, with Brazil showing a slightly greater concentration compared to Europe. \nRegarding punctuality, unique trends were evident in both regions, not solely attributable to the extent of traffic resurgence. In Brazil, a consistently higher proportion of flights arrived significantly early, a pattern largely unaffected when comparing 2019 to 2022. Conversely, the documented challenges of European airports in coping with the recovering traffic demand in 2022 highlighted the repercussions of their lower preparedness levels.\nThe recorded throughput at Brazilian airports exhibited less variability amid the pandemic, indicating a sustained demand concentration during peak operational hours. In the European context, innovative operational ideas present the most substantial potential for growth, considering the existing runway systems and associated capacities, which set an upper limit.\nThe fresh dataset for Brazil reaffirmed past patterns regarding the extra time spent in terminal airspace. Typically, arrival sequencing and limited capacity lead to extended times during the arrival phase. In Europe, reduced air traffic translated to less strain on arrival sequencing. Yet, the notable rise from 2021 to 2022 in multiple airports implies that constraints and heightened sequencing might resurface as demand increases.\n\n\nThis report will be updated throughout the coming years under the umbrella of the DECEA-EUROCONTROL memorandum of cooperation. It is also planned to establish a web-based rolling monitoring updated on a regular basis.\nFuture editions will complement the data time series and support the development of further use-case analyses. The lessons learnt of this joint project will be coordinated with the multi-national Performance Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) and the ICAO GANP Study sub-group concerned with the further development of the GANP Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).",

    "text": "1.1 Background\nAir transportation is a key economic driver in Brazil and Europe. Both regions share the political goal of a performance-based approach to foster the continual growth and efficiency of air transport. It is recognised that Air Navigation Services (ANS) play a critical role in terms of limiting the constraints on airspace user operations. Accordingly, the analysis and regional comparison of operational ANS performance informs about trends over time, the success of change implementation, and potential performance benefit pools for future exploitation.\nWith a view to a tigher collaboration between Brazil and Europe, DECEA and EUROCONTROL signed a cooperation agreement in 2015. This agreement encompasses various activities, most notably cooperation and joint initiatives in the domain of operational performance benchmarking of ANS.\nThe close technical collaboration of the Performance Section of DECEA and EUROCONTROL’s Performance Review Unit comprises the further development and validation of proposed ICAO GANP indicators, regular performance related data exchange, and the production of regional or multi-regional performance reports. An essential part of this work entails the identification and validation of comparable data sources, the development of a joint data prepartory process, and supporting analyses to produce this report or contribute to the aforementioned international activities.\nThis report represents the third edition of joint comparisons between Brazil and Europe.",

It is important to note that the comparative analysis outlined in this iteration of the report does not encompass all eleven Key Performance Areas (KPA) as presented in Figure 1.\nFrom an indicator perspective, the DECEA Performance Section and PRU have reached a consensus to concentrate on operational benchmarking and aligning their efforts with the performance indicators proposed by ICAO in conjunction with the update of the Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP).

    "section": "1.3 Geographical Scope",
    "text": "1.3 Geographical Scope\nThis report’s geographical focus encompasses Brazil and Europe.\nAirspace control in Brazil is a fully integrated civil-military operation. The Brazilian Air Force is responsible for air defence and air traffic control functions. Within this framework, the Department of Airspace Control (DECEA) operates as a governmental entity under the authority of the Brazilian Air Force Command. DECEA plays a pivotal role by coordinating and furnishing human resources and technical equipment to all air traffic units operating within Brazilian territory. This collaboration ensures air traffic safety while contributing to military defence efforts.\nDECEA is the cornerstone of the Brazilian Airspace Control System (SISCEAB). This department provides air navigation services for the vast airspace jurisdiction covering 22 million square kilometres, including oceanic areas. The Brazilian airspace is further divided into five Flight Information Regions (FIR) and the areas of responsibility of these integrated Centres for Air Defence and Air Traffic Control (CINDACTA) are depicted in Figure 1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Brazilian Airspace Structure/FIRs (CINDACTAs)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CINDACTAs merge civilian air traffic control with military air defence operations. In addition to the CINDACTAs, there’s the Regional Center of Southeast Airspace Control (CRCEA-SE), tasked with managing air traffic in the densely congested terminal areas of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: European Airspace and EUROCONTROL Member States\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this report, Europe, i.e. the European airspace, is defined as the area where the 42 EUROCONTROL member states provide air navigation services, excluding the oceanic areas and the Canary islands (c.f. Figure 1.2). In 2016, EUROCONTROL signed a comprehensive agreement with Israel and Morocco. Both comprehensive agreement States will be successively fully integrated into the working structures of EUROCONTROL, including performance monitoring. Within this report, these states are included in the reported network traffic volumes.\nEUROCONTROL is an inter-governmental organisation working towards a highly harmonised European air traffic management system. In general, air traffic services are provided by air navigation service providers entrusted by the different EUROCONTROL member states. Dependent on the local and national regimes, there is a mix of civil and military service providers, and integrated service provision.\nThe Maastricht Upper Area Control Center is operated by EUROCONTROL on behalf of 4 States (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg, and Germany). It is the only multi-national cross-border air traffic unit in Europe at the time being. Given the European context and airspace structure, the European area comprises 37 ANSPs with 62 en-route centres and 16 stand-alone Approach Control Units (i.e. totalling 78 air traffic service units).\nEurope employs a collaborative approach to manage and service airspace and air traffic. This includes the integration of military objectives and requirements which need to be fully coordinated within the ATM System. A variety of coordination cells/procedures exists between civil air traffic control centres and air defence units reflecting the local practices. Many EUROCONTROL member states are members of NATO and have their air defence centres / processes for civil-military coordination aligned under the integrated NATO air defence system.\nFurther details on the organisation of the regional air navigation systems in Brazil and Europe will be provided in Section 2.1.\n\n1.3.1 Study Airports\nAs concerns airport-related operational air navigation performance, this edition of the comparison report addresses the performance at a set of selected airports. These airports represent the top-10 or most relevant airports in terms of IFR movements in both regions and allow to make meaningful comparisons.\nIn Brazil, the selected airports play a significant role for the national and regional connectivity, including the major hubs for international air traffic. These study airports have consolidated systems and structured processes for data collection in support of this comparison report.\nFor the European context, the study airports comprise the busiest airports in several states exhibiting a mix of national, regional, and international air traffic. These airports are also characterised by varying operational constraints that make them excellent candidates for an international comparison. All of these airports are subject to the performance monitoring under the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System and provide movement related data on the basis of a harmonised data specification.\nFigure 1.3 provides an overview of the location of the chosen study airports within both regions. The airports are also listed in Table 1.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: List of study airports for the Brazil / Europe operational ANS performance comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil\nEurope\n\n\n\n\nBrasília (SBBR)\nAmsterdam Schiphol (EHAM)\n\n\nSão Paulo Guarulhos (SBGR)\nParis Charles de Gaulle (LFPG)\n\n\nSão Paulo Congonhas (SBSP)\nLondon Heathrow (EGLL)\n\n\nCampinas (SBKP)\nFrankfurt (EDDF)\n\n\nRio de Janeiro S.

    "text": "1.4 Data Sources\nThe nature of the performance indicator requires the collection of data from different sources. DECEA Performance Section and PRU investigated the comparability of the data available in both regions, including the data pre-processes, data cleaning and aggregation, to ensure a harmonised set of data for performance comparison purposes.\nDECEA mainly uses data from the tower systems of the main airports as a data source for performance studies. The control tower system collects and provides data for each landing and take-off operation automatically. This edition blended ANAC (Brazilian CAA) official and public data with DECEA’s data to increase precision for specific indicators, adding a pre-processing phase to the data analytical work. The provided data include such items as the times of operations, gate entry and exit, and flight origin and destination.\nWithin the European context, PRU has established a variety of performance-related data collection processes. For this report the main sources are the European Air Traffic Flow Management System (ETFMS 2) complemented with airport operator reported data. These sources are combined to establish a flight-by-flight record. This ensures consistent data for arrivals and departures at the chosen study airports. The data is collected on a monthly basis and typically processed for the regular performance reporting under the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System and the Single European Sky Performance and Charging Scheme (EUROCONTROL 2019).",

    "text": "2.1 Organisation of Air Navigation Services\nOne of the major difference between the air navigation systems of Brazil and Europe is the respective organisational structure. In Brazil, a single entity serves as the primary air navigation services provider, i.e. the Department of Airspace Control (DECEA). In contrast, in Europe, each member state has delegated the responsibility for service provision to either national or local providers.\nDECEA holds the vital role of overseeing all activities related to the safety and efficiency of Brazilian airspace control. Its mission encompasses the management and control of all air traffic within the sovereign Brazilian airspace, with a significant emphasis on contributing to national defence efforts. To achieve this, DECEA operates a comprehensive and fully integrated civil-military system.\nIn 2021, a public company, NAV Brasil, was created to take over some facilities that were linked to an old airport infrastructure provider company in Brazil (INFRAERO). Today, this company has 1698 employees in 44 different units, providing aerodrome control services, nonradar approach, meteorology and aeronautical information for these locations. Despite having important numbers, Nav Brasil does not plan to establish radar facilities or provide en-route services.\nThe Brazilian airspace, covering an area of approximately 22 million square kilometres (8.5 million square nautical miles of non-oceanic airspace), is divided into five Flight Information Regions. These regions are further subdivided and managed by five Area Control Centers (ACC), 57 Tower facilities (TWR), one digital tower (D-TWR), 41 Approach Units (APP) and 79 AFIS/Remote-AFIS.\nThe non-oceanic airspace in Europe covers an area of 11.5 million square kilometres. When it comes to the provision of air traffic services, the European approach involves a multitude of service providers, with 37 distinct en-route Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), each responsible for different geographical regions. These services are primarily organised along state boundaries and FIR (Flight Information Region) borders, with limited cross-border agreements in place between adjacent airspaces and air traffic service units.\nA noteworthy exception to this predominantly national approach is the Maastricht Upper Area Control (UAC), which represents a unique multinational collaboration offering air traffic services in the upper airspace of northern Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.\nCivil-military integration levels across European countries vary. Within the European context, the central coordination of Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) and Airspace Management (ASM) is facilitated by the Network Manager. The design of airspace and related procedures is no longer developed and implemented in isolation in Europe. Inefficiencies in the design and utilisation of the air route network are recognised as contributing factors to flight inefficiencies in the region. Therefore, as part of the European Union’s Single European Sky initiative, the Network Manager is tasked with developing an integrated European Route Network Design. This is achieved through a Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) process involving all stakeholders.\nAnother critical responsibility of the Network Manager is to ensure that air traffic flows do not exceed the safe handling capacity of air traffic service units while optimising available capacity. To accomplish this, the Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC) continuously monitors the air traffic situation and proposes flow management measures through the CDM process in coordination with the respective local authorities. This coordination typically occurs with the local Flow Management Positions (FMP) within the respective area control centres. Subsequently, the NMOC implements the relevant flow management initiatives as requested by the authorities or FMPs.",

    "section": "2.2 High Level System Comparison",
    "text": "2.2 High Level System Comparison\nFigure 2.1 summarises the key characteristics of the Brazilian and European air navigation system for 2024. Comparing the high-level numbers, Brazil utilised an increased number of Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) even during the pandemic period. In contrast, the European system showed a reduction of total ATCOs in service. The different behaviour suggests a difference in work force flexibility between the systems. This may be partly explained by the fact that DECEA shares part of the structure used in basic training with other Air Force training processes. This leads to a more centralised and rigid process, in which abrupt reactions in hiring planning are unwanted due to the lengthy process of calling for candidates according to Brazilian laws related to public service jobs. In Europe, there exists a mix of organisational models and labour contracts ranging from public service to fully commercial organisation. En gros, European providers were able to react to the lower demand levels by delaying/stopping recruitment/training and offering early retirement packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: High Level Comparison 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother key difference affecting performance in both regions for this report is the development of air traffic demand. Unlike in Europe, it is interesting to note that Brazil ended 2022 already servicing air traffic movements above the pre-pandemic (i.e. 2019) level. However, as will be shown later, much of this growth was due to the strong increase in general aviation and only to a lower extent in commercial aviation.\nOverall, the volume of air traffic also rebounded in Europe. At the end of 2023, the level reached about 90% of the pre-pandemc air traffic (vs about 85% in 2022).\nBoth regions operate with similar operational concepts, procedures and supporting technology. Yet, Brazil, with lower traffic density related to airspace use, finds probably a more challenging cost-benefit ratio to maintain communication coverage and surveillance for regions with low-traffic. In comparison, the European region faces more considerable challenges in coordinating efforts to adress operational constraints and service the current demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe following graphic is a snapshot made in early April.\nThe network analysis is work in progress. Thus, the visualisation and section may change, and with a smaller data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Airport Rank Comparison 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nThis report launched a first analysis of the systems’ network utilisation, taking advantage of the rich experience in comparing two regional aviation systems. Aviation infrastructure is always expensive and complex to maintain, including cost for the provision of air navigation services. The analysis of the facilities’ locations distribution for this service has always basically accompanied the distribution of airports in a region. Recently, technological feasibility modified this logic with the possibility of remote services and still with the possibility of joining more than one remote installation to provide services to several locations simultaneously.\nStill, a closer look at the dynamics of these routes and potential connectivity between sites may indicate the potential for capacity to be exploited by the aviation community or that idle capacity is installed without reasonable prospects for use.\nIn Figure 2.2, we see the distribution of commercial departures for 2022 in both regions. Note that the concentration is proportionally slightly higher on the Brazilian side, with less than 50 airports handlinging 80% of the commercial take-offs that year. In comparison, the European system distributed the same percentage over approximately 100 airports.\nFor both regions, the aforementioned share of air traffic is centralised in a small subset of airports. On the other hand, the cumulative charts in Figure 2.2 show that a high number of airports service under 1% of the regional air traffic volume. In both systems, this represents more than half of the airports that serve commercial flights. In Europe, approximately 486 airports handle only 1% of the movements, while in Brazil, there are 210 for the same percentage.\nDespite being an already historically established distribution and somewhat expected, the aviation sector agents must revisit this data constantly to verify the use of deployed resources and capacity. There is scope for further assessing the service provision at smaller operations with a view to accommodate demand and capacity.\nAnalysing the part of ANS, specifically on the Brazilian side, the proportion of flights using AFIS aerodromes in this sample is 10.73%. Among them, the busiest airport serviced approximately 4146 commercial departures in 2022 while only 124 were handled at the least busy AFIS aerodrome. In most cases, these operations represent remote airports where aviation is deemed needed to give access to that community. For the European data, a similar pattern is expected. The current data does not allow for a labelling of all aerodromes in terms of ATS service provision (in particular, the identification of AFIS-only services).\nFuture work may highlight to what extent also resources within the European context are bound to establishing basic connectivity. Further research can explore how both regions can maximise installed capacity, benefit from novel operational or technical concepts, and suggest improvements for ANS provision.",

    "text": "2.3 Regional Approach to Operational Performance Monitoring\nThe previous report detailed the historic setup of the performance monitoring systems in Brazil and Europe.\nThe implementation of the performance-based approach is not a fundamental new activity in Europe. The Performance Review Commission (PRC) was established within EUROCONTROL in 1998 aiming to establish and implement an independent European air traffic management (ATM) performance review capability in response to the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Institutional Strategy. The main goal of the PRC is to offer impartial advice on pan-European ATM performance to EUROCONTROL’s governing bodies. Supported by the Performance Review Unit (PRU), the PRC conducts extensive research, data analysis, and consultations to provide objective insights and recommendations. EUROCONTROL’s performance review system, a pioneering initiative in the late 1990s, has influenced broader forums like ICAO’s global performance approach and the Single European Sky (SES) performance scheme. Collaborating internationally, particularly with ICAO, the PRC aims to harmonise air navigation practices. The PRC produces annual reports (ACE and PRR) and provides operational performance monitoring through various data products and online tools. Continuous efforts are made to expand the online reporting for stakeholders and ensure access to independent performance data for informed decision-making.\nIt is noteworthy to recall that DECEA, influenced by ICAO publications, embraced a performance-based approach, notably advancing the national state-of-the-art in collaboration with EUROCONTROL. Beginning with the SIRIUS Brazil Program in 2012, DECEA faced challenges defining metrics, but made significant progress after signing a Cooperation Agreement with EUROCONTROL in 2015. DECEA published crucial documents for ICAO’s Global Air Navigation Plan, prompting an organisational transformation and adaptation of practices. Establishing the ATM Performance Section in 2019, akin to EUROCONTROL’s PRU, DECEA accelerated the build-up of expertise in operational performance monitoring. This culminated in the publication of the first Brazilian ATM Performance Plan for 2022-2023. Actively fostering an open culture of knowledge-sharing within South America, DECEA engaged in workshops and seminars, and inviting EUROCONTROL for collaboration.\nFinally, it should be noted that the recurrent use of indicators by EUROCONTROL and DECEA and the close technical collaboration taking place during the analysis periods for joint conclusions enrich not only the two regions but also have a global impact. Embracing transparency, both agencies made indicators and databases publicly accessible, perpetuating a culture of reciprocity and transparency for mutual advancement. Looking for broader validation and harmonisation, the lessons learned from this scheme are systematically shared with the multi-national Performance Benchmarking Working Group (PBWG) and the Performance Expert Group of the ICAO GANP Study Group, which deals with the development of GANP Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this respect, this collaboration between both parties serves as a role model for ANS performance management on a global level.\nUpdated dashboards, previous work, and supporting historical data are available at https://ansperformance.eu/global/brazil/ or https://performance.decea.mil.br/.",

    "text": "2.4 Summary\nWhile both regions operate on similar operational concepts and technologies, there exists key characteristics and distinctions in both regions. One of the key differences is the overall organisation of air navigation services. Brazil’s air navigation services are centralised under DECEA, overseeing all airspace control and contributing to national defense. In contrast, Europe’s air navigation services are provided by multiple entities and ANSPs operating predominantly within their national state boundaries and FIR borders.\nAlso remarkable is the comparison of the number of air traffic controllers between Brazil and Europe during the pandemic. This revealed contrasting trends. Brazil experienced an increase in ATCOs, while Europe witnessed a notable reduction. This disparity underscores a significant difference in the systems’ responsiveness, partly attributed to Brazil’s centralised and rigid hiring process. At the same time, European providers operate with greater independence and flexibility enabling easier adjustments to the management of the ATCO workforce.\nThe distribution of commercial flights in 2022 indicates that only a subset of airports handle 80% of commercial take-offs. The concentration effect is higher in Brazil than in Europe. On the other hand, a high number of airports operating commercial flights represent handle only a marginal share of 1% of the movements in both systems. This duality may inform decision-makers about potential performance benefit pools with a view to allocate scarce ANS resources and capabilities and ensure the proper balancing of demand and capacity.\nThis report documents the close collaboration between DECEA and EUROCONTROL. The effort benefits the two regions and contributes globally by sharing insights and lessons learned with international aviation communities, aiding the development of ATM performance management worldwide.",

    "text": "3.1 Network Level Air Traffic\nFigure 3.1 shows the regional traffic development in Brazil and Europe. In both regions the unprecedented decline in air traffic occurred in March 2020 in the aftermath of the pandemic-declaration by the World Health Organisation. However, there is a difference in terms of the overall recovery. The European recovery is characterised by two waves, while a single setback is observed in Brazil in second quarter of 2021. The European pattern demonstrates the difficulty in the coordination of a joint policy of curbing the pandemic and managing travel related constraints. With different states in Europe introducing public health and travel constraints at differnt times, intra-European traffic was affected by the piece-meal approach. Brazil - and its policy on air transport - benefitted from single stance on policy implementation.\nFigure 3.1: Regional daily air traffic\nFor Brazil, it is important to remember that Figure 3.1 shows the aggregated movements per airport at the whole network level. The shown total does not necessarily reflect the total number of flights. Another important observation related to the data is that Brazil’s number of airports served with the TATIC tool (Tower ATC System) has increased. Despite raising the processed total daily flight number, this difference is mostly transparent for this study as these additional airports handle only a small number of movements on a day-to-day basis.\nThe movements already surpassed the 2019 levels for the Brazilian region, confirming some economic recovery in the market. According to the CGNA (Brazilian Network Manager) assessment, general aviation is the leading actor in this frame. The share of “Light” aircraft in the fleet mix observed at Brazilian airports and the prevailing airline traffic levels still below the 2019 traffic in the airlines’ preferred airports help to confirm this thesis.\nIn terms of total network level air traffic, the European region is still lagging behind its pre-pandemic levels. Other analyses showed that low-cost carriers recovered more agile than the classical mainline carriers. The low-cost sector, thus, shows a higher numbers of operations than pre-pandemic as their financial model allowed for a more agile reaction in terms of staffing/crewing/servicing flights. The higher share can also be explained by a side-effect of the national support measures for some of the mainline carriers. These measures included freeing slots at major hubs and the reduction of domestic / short-haul operations. Accordingly, the European network is characterised by a change in the level of connectivity and frequency of services between the different airports.\nFigure 3.2: Evolution of annual network traffic\nThis high-level network perspective shows that traffic in both regions is comparable to pre-pandemic levels. It will be interesting to observe the further evolution and growth of air traffic.",

This reports looks in particular at the performance levels observed at 10 key airports in each region (c.f. scope)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Europeaan airport level traffic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the movement of the leading Brazilian airports, it is evident that they were not responsible for the return to 2019 levels, considering that only Campinas - SBKP and Santos Dumont - SBRJ slightly exceeded 2019 levels. This phenomenon can be explained by the greater difficulty of airlines in resuming activity in contrast to general/business aviation. This last share is an essential component of the Brazilian air movement but is a rare user of main airports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Annual traffic at study airports in 2022 and variation 2022/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4 shows the annual change of the traffic served at the study airports in 2022 and the associated change of the traffic levels comparing 2022 and 2019.\nWith Campinas (SBKP) and Rio de Janeiro (SBRJ), there are two study airports in Brazil that serviced a higher level of traffic in 2022 than in 2019. Both airports are key nodes for the domestic traffic in Brazil. Salvador (SBSV) ranged at the pre-pandemic level. The other Brazilian airports have seen - on average - a decrease of 10-20% of traffic. This suggests that the observed network level increase in movements is distributed across the Brazilian network and not focussed on the airports covered in this study.\nThe European airport level traffic - on average - ranged at 20% below the pre-pandemic levels. Munich (EDDM) and Rome (LIRF) observed higher reductions. With an overall weaker recovery of the air traffic demand across Europe in 2022, a similar pattern emerged. The increased network level traffic (ranging about 10% under the pre-pandemic level) is distributed across the European network and other aerodrome connections.",

In both regions, “medium” aircraft types are the predominant aircraft type. The fleet mix - and in particular the separation requirements between the different aircraft types - is an important influencing factor for the capacity and observed (and achievable) throughput. In general, a larger proportions of heavy aircraft or aircraft with longer runway occupancy times may result in lower throughput due to the required larger wake turbulence separation or time spent on the runway. The locally defined capacity values may therefore differ based on the predominant fleet mix and operational characteristics, and ultimately result in different observed peak movement numbers or influence surface and terminal operations.\nIn Brazil, a significant number of “light” types operated in 2023. For example Salvador (SBSV) serviced about 20% of “light” types. The major hubs, i.e. São Paulo Guarulhos (SBGR), Rio de Janeiro Galeão (SBGL), and Campinas (SBKP) observed a share of 15-20% of “heavy” aircraft. These airports serve also as destinations for international long-haul flights.\nWith the exception of Zurich (LSZH), the share of “light” types is negligible at the European study airport in 2023. London Heathrow (EGLL), Paris Charles de Gaule (LFPG), and Frankfurt (EDDF) observed the highest shares of “heavy” types.\nWithin the European region - and its multitude of national hubs - a significant number of international long-haul flights is operated at the chosen study airports. In Brazil, the highlighted airports, Guarulhos (SBGR), Galeão (SBGL), and Campinas (SBKP), play a major role in terms of international connectivity. It follows that medium and light types are used predominantly for inter-reginal connections. Based on the selected study airports, the underlying decentralised structure of the European network becomes more visible. Due to the geo-political composition, airports serving capitals or representing a main national hub are more frequent in Europe. This is in contrast to Brazil, where the international and heavy air traffic appears more centralised at 2-3 pre-dominant hubs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Fleet mix change over time observed at study airports\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, Figure 3.6 shows that the fleetmix remained fairly stable over the years.

    "text": "3.6 Summary\nThis chapter described the overall evolution of air traffic in Brazil and Europe on the network and study airport level. Air traffic observed an unprecedented decline in both regions in response to COVID19. However, the recovery path in both regions differed. Overall, the Brazilian demand recovered substantially smoother than the European. As national governments varied in their assessments and introduction of public health measures, including travel restrictions, intra-European air connectivity observed several setbacks. On a network level, air traffic in Brazil exceeded the pre-pandemic level, whereas European traffic reaches about 5-10% below the pre-pandemic level.\nIn 2023, medium aircraft types were predominant in both regions across the studied airports. Brazil hosted proportionally more light aircraft, notably in Salvador (SBSV). At the same time, major hubs like São Paulo Guarulhos (SBGR) and Campinas (SBKP) handled substantial shares of heavy aircraft. Conversely, European airports, except Zurich (LSZH), had minimal shares of light types, with London Heathrow (EGLL), Paris Charles de Gaule (LFPG), and Frankfurt (EDDF) witnessing higher shares of heavy types. The European network demonstrated a decentralized structure with numerous international long-haul flights, while Brazil’s international and heavy air traffic was centralized in 3 primary hubs. Despite pandemic-induced declines in air transport, data suggests a stable fleet mix, indicating a consistent impact across traffic segments.\nThe overall air traffic demand situation is a key driver for the performance of air navigation services. The observed differences may impact - inter alia - separation and synchronisation of air traffic, and influence the observed performance reported in the other chapters of this report.",

When comparing both regions in 2019 and 2022, Brazil’s share of early arrivals (earlier than 15 minutes before the scheduled arrival) is significantly higher than the same European portion. The share of early arrivals accounts for 20-25% across all Brazilian airports. In Europe, flights tend not to arrive significantly earlier than their scheduled time. On average, early arrival range between 8-15% in Europe in 2019. Recent studies conducted by the CGNA/DECEA show that air operators in Brazil declare flight times significantly longer than observed. Similar behaviour is also observed in Europe. Built in buffer times help to achieve a high “on-time-performance” record and appeal to passengers favouring a timely arrival performance. Furthermore, both regions have regulations for passenger compensation in place which are triggered in the case of arrival delays. DECEA has already established a forum with the air operator regulator to discuss and propose solutions.\nFigure 4.2: Evolution of arrival punctuality window\nFigure 4.3: Evolution of arrival punctuality window by month\nEuropean airports saw their share of punctual flights in 2022 decrease broadly compared to 2019, even with a more proportional distribution than the Brazilian system. For European operators, there were two primary factors contributing the the lower performance in 2022. The most significant is the cumulative effect, showing that the network of flights has little ability to absorb the delay of one specific delayed flight. The knock-on effect was amplified by the local resource constraints in terms of passenger and turn-around facilitation. The incrasing traffic demand posed challenges at many airports in Europe. Delayed arrivals accumulated further reactionary delay and ultimately passed the delay systematically on to next flights. Further constraints were linked to air space and flow restrictions resulting from the geo-political conflict surrounding the Russian invasion in Ukraine. On average, arrival delays of 15 minutes or more compared to the schedule ranged between 25-35% across the Europen study airports in 2022.\nFigure 4.4: Change of share of early and late arrivals (2019 vs 2022)\nFigure 4.4 compares the share of early and late arrivals at each study airport in 2019 and 2022. From a high-level perspective, air traffic tends to arrive well ahead of schedule in Brazil, while Europe observes a higher share of delayed arrivals. Guarulhos (SBGR) remained the Brazilian airport with the highest share of early flights in 2022 (i.e. 33%), followed by Campinas (SBKP) with 30%. Both airports are essential hubs in the country, and anticipation can be a consequence sought by air operators for better accommodation of the flight network. However, for flow control, this lack of precision is equally problematic, affecting the optimal allocation of resources for the provision of air traffic control and flow service. In turn, Madrid (LEMD) was the European element with the most significant share of early arrivals (i.e. 22%) in 2022. Pre-pandemic such a share was observed at London Heathrow in 2019. These shares still range about 11% lower than the highest shares in Brazil. The distorted nature of the European network in 2022 becomes apparent when observing the share of delayed flights. For example services at London Gatwick (EGKK) faced a share of 39% of delayed flights. Airport operators were identified as the major contributors to primary delays (ground handling, staff shortage), followed by ATFM delays. However, the aforementioned reactionary effect was the main driver of knock-on delays (EUROCONTROL Central Office of Delay Analysis 2023) 1.",

In this section, we assess the degree of departure punctuality measured as the difference between the scheduled (i.e. planned) departure versus the observed actual off-block time. Figure 4.5 shows the overall departure punctuality at Brazilian and European airports in 2019 compared to 2022. Despite traffic levels in 2022 still ranging below their 2019 pre-pandemic levels, the departure punctuality in 2022 was - on average - lower than before COVID.\nThe difference in departure and arrival punctuality between 2022 and 2019 was significantly more pronounced for Europe indicating an increased strain on the turnaround processes. There has been a significant increase in poor performance days, with departure punctuality falling below 50% and arrival punctuality dropping below 60%, occurring more frequently than in 2019. On the Brazilian side, the Galeão airport (SBGL) observed the highest share of delayed departure flights. It should be noted that the SBGL is the only airport with the Apron Control service directly provided by the airport. Some inefficiency in the coordination between Tower and Apron or divergence at the indicator collection point for the location may be contributing to the observed performance.\nDeparture punctuality appeared slightly higher in Brazil in 2022 in comparison to 2019 and outperforms the punctuality levels observed in Europe. It is also notworthy, that in Brazil there is a higher share of flights blocking off between 15 to 5 minutes before their scheduled time. Further research may help to clarify the factors driving this phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Change of share of early and late departures (2023 vs 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe change of the share of early and late departures in 2019 and 2022 is shown in Figure 4.8. This presentation highlights the earlier observations. On average, European airports observed a higher share of delayed departures by a factor of 2-3 in comparison to Brazil. While the picture varies, the distored nature of the traffic in 2022 is visible in the higher share of delay departures in 2022 in Europe in comparison to the pre-pandemic levels in 2019. This put a strain on the schedule stability across Europe. Local issues (e.g. reduced facilication capacity at airports) affected air traffic services in terms of surface movement, but also rippled into the network affecting the sequencing of arrivals and departure traffic.",

    "text": "4.3 Summary\nArrival and departure punctuality play an important role in terms of balancing demand and capacity. Strong distortions of the schedule will ultimately ripple down into reactionary delay and require a higher effort for both the arrival flow and surface movement control. Turnaround distortions affect therefore the planning accuracy of air navigation services and may lead to unwanted side-effects (e.g. longer sequencing and holding in the terminal airspace, passenger inconvenience due to longer taxi-times/blocked gates).\nDistinct patterns were observed in both regions that cannot only be explained by the level of traffic recovery. On average, a higher share of flights arrives well ahead of schedule in Brazil. This pattern is largely unchanged when comparing 2019 and 2022. The ripple effect of the low preparedness level of European airports to address the returning traffic in 2022 is well documented. This yielded a significant low performance in terms of departure punctuality exceeding levels observed in Brazil by a factor of 2-3. Distortions of the local schedule can have knock-on effects on the air navigation service provision, both in terms of surface movement and arrival sequencing. More research is needed to investigate and understand the underlying drivers and to what extent regional connectivity influences the observed patterns.\n\n\n\n\nEUROCONTROL Central Office of Delay Analysis. 2023. “All-Causes Delays to Air Transport in Europe, Annual 2022.” https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/all-causes-delays-air-transport-europe-annual-2022.",
