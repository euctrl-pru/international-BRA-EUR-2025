  abstract = {Reducing the length of departure queues at runway entry points is one of the most important requirements for reducing aircraft traffic congestion and fuel consumption at airports. This study designs an aircraft departure model at a runway using a time-varying fluid queue. The proposed model enables us to determine the aircraft waiting time in the departure queue and to evaluate effective control approaches for assigning suitable holds at gates rather than runway entry points. As a case study, this study modeled the departure queue at runway 05 of Tokyo International Airport for an entire day of operations. Using actual traffic data of departures at the airport, the model estimates that aircraft spend a total of 2.5 h departure waiting time in a day at runway 05. Considering the stochastic nature of actual departure traffic, the relevance of the proposed model is discussed using validation criteria. The model estimation shows a reasonable, expected order of magnitude compared with the departure queue recorded in the actual traffic data. Furthermore, ecological and economic benefits are quantitatively evaluated assuming a reduction in the departure queue length. Our results show that about one kiloton of fuel oil per year is wasted due to aircraft waiting to depart from a single departure runway.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to calculate the fuel consumption and emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and hydrocarbons (HC) in the taxi-out period of aircraft at the International Diyarbakir Airport in 2018 and 2019. Design/methodology/approach Calculations were performed by determining the engine operating times in the taxi-out period with the flight data obtained from the airport authority. In the analyses, aircraft series and aircraft engine types were determined, and the Engine Exhaust Emission Databank of the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) were used for the calculation. Findings Total fuel consumption in the taxi-out period in 2018 and 2019 was calculated as 525.64 and 463.69 tons, respectively. In 2018, HC, CO and NOx emissions caused by fuel consumption were found to be 1,109, 10,668 and 2,339 kg, respectively. In 2019, the total HC, CO and NOx emissions released to the atmosphere during the taxi-out phase are 966, 9,391 and 2,126 kg, respectively. B737 Series aircraft have the largest share in total fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Practical implications This study explains the importance of determining fuel consumption and pollutant emissions by considering engine operating times in the taxi-out period. The study provides aviation authorities with scientific methods to follow in calculating fuel consumption and emissions from aircraft operations. Originality/value The originality of this study is the calculation of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions by determining real-time engine running times in the taxi-out period. In addition, calculations were made with real engine operating times determined in the taxi-out period using real flight data.},

  abstract = {Flight phases are essential for many applications of aviation research. In this project, a novel machine learning model for the identification of flight phases is presented. The identification is performed on aircraft trajectory data, which in contrast to other flight data, is a publicly available resource obtained through the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) concept. With the help of supervised simulation data, a model that aims at improving state-of-the-art flight phase identification on trajectory data is developed. The model combines Kmeans clustering, allowing the segmentation to capture transitions between phases more closely, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, able to learn the dynamics of a flight. The improvement of this work, compared with the state-ofthe-art model by Sun et al. [41] based on fuzzy logic, comprises: increasing the accuracy by more than 2\%, adhering to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standard, and increasing the number of flight phases to include take-off, landing, and others. The latter shows potential, considering the performance on simulation data, however, requires more realistic training data to achieve similar performance on actual flights.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the United States air transportation network between March and August 2020. Despite dramatic reductions in flight and passenger volumes, the network remained robust and resilient against perturbation. Although 24\% of airports closed, the reduction in network efficiency was only 5.1\%, which means airlines continued to serve most destinations. A deeper analysis of airport closures reveals that 1) small peripheral airports were the most likely to be closed; 2) socio-economic and epidemiological factors characterizing the airport's region such as income, income inequality, political leaning, and the number of observed COVID cases were not predictive of airport closure. Finally, we show that high network robustness has a downside: although emissions from United States air traffic in 2020 fell by 37.4\% compared to 2019, mostly due to the drop in the number of flights, emissions per passenger doubled in the period April to August 2020 and increased eightfold in the week of April 5\textendash 11. This rise indicates inefficient use of resources by airlines.}

There has been much public debate about financing, but little about the sort of concrete projects that the EU should be putting public money into. * Here we propose a 10-year, \texteuro 2tn investment programme focusing on public health, transport infrastructure and energy/decarbonisation. * It consists of two pillars. In a national pillar Member States - broadly as in the Commission proposal - would be allocated \texteuro 500bn. Resources should be focused on the hardest-hit countries and front-loaded: we suggest over a three-year horizon. * The bulk of the money - \texteuro 1.5tn - would be devoted to finance genuinely European projects, where there is an EU value added. We describe a series of flagship initiatives that the EU could launch in the fields of public health, transport infrastructure and energy/decarbonisation. * We call for a strengthened EU public health agency that invests in health-staff skills and then facilitates their flexible deployment in emergencies, and is tasked with ensuring supplies of vital medicines (Health4EU). * We present costed proposals for two ambitious transport initiatives: a dedicated European high-speed rail network, the Ultra-Rapid-Train, with four-routes cutting travel times between EU capitals and regions, and, alternatively, an integrated European Silk Road initiative that combines transport modes on the Chinese model. * In the area of energy/decarbonisation we seek to "electrify" the Green Deal. We call for funding to accelerate the realisation of a smart and integrated electricity grid for 100\%-renewable energy transmission (e-highway), support for complementary battery and green-hydrogen projects, and a programme, modelled on the SURE initiative, to co-finance member-state decarbonisation and Just Transition policies. * The crisis induced by the pandemic, coming as it does on top of the financial and euro crises, poses a huge challenge. The response needs to take account of the longer-run structural challenges, and above all that of climate change. The European Union should rise to these challenges in the reform of an ambitious medium-run recovery programme, appropriately financed. An outline of such a programme is set out here by way of illustration, but many permutations and options are available to policymakers.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 global pandemic hit the aviation industry hard since the end of 2019. It has had an immediate, dramatic impact on airport traffic and revenue. Airports are the important nodes in the aviation system network, and the failure of a single airport can often affect the surrounding airports. The purpose of our analysis is to show how is the resilience and recovery of airports in the global public health crisis. Much research on resilience can be found in air transportation networks facing natural hazards or extreme weather, which focus on the robustness of the airport network. These methods are not suitable for the global public health event. Therefore, based on the collection of existing data, we combined with existing resilience measurement methods to analyze the resilience and recovery of airports during the global public health crisis. The resilience metrics results reflect the recovery of airports very well under different strategies. Here, we analyze airport network resilience by considering the performance-based methods. We integrate some metrics such as aircraft movements, passenger throughput, and freight throughput in the resilience metrics model, comparing the resilience evaluation under different preventive and control strategies, which can reflect the airport\&\#x2019;s recovery speed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis indicates that the aviation system network deteriorates soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, but the recovery level of the aviation industry depends on what measures are taken to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, the recovery of the aviation system network in Europe takes longer than in China, due to different prevention and control strategies for COVID-19. The study proves that the emergency response ability of the country for the public health crisis has a significant positive impact on speeding up the recovery of the aviation system.}

  abstract = {Modeling and evaluating the resilience of systems, potentially complex and large-scale in nature, has recently raised significant interest among both practitioners and researchers. This recent interest has resulted in several definitions of the concept of resilience and several approaches to measuring this concept, across several application domains. As such, this paper presents a review of recent research articles related to defining and quantifying resilience in various disciplines, with a focus on engineering systems. We provide a classification scheme to the approaches in the literature, focusing on qualitative and quantitative approaches and their subcategories. Addressed in this review are: an extensive coverage of the literature, an exploration of current gaps and challenges, and several directions for future research.},

The proposed model enables us to determine the aircraft waiting time in the departure queue and to evaluate effective control approaches for assigning suitable holds at gates rather than runway entry points. As a case study, this study modeled the departure queue at runway 05 of Tokyo International Airport for an entire day of operations. Using actual traffic data of departures at the airport, the model estimates that aircraft spend a total of 2.5 h departure waiting time in a day at runway 05. Considering the stochastic nature of actual departure traffic, the relevance of the proposed model is discussed using validation criteria. The model estimation shows a reasonable, expected order of magnitude compared with the departure queue recorded in the actual traffic data. Furthermore, ecological and economic benefits are quantitatively evaluated assuming a reduction in the departure queue length. Our results show that about one kiloton of fuel oil per year is wasted due to aircraft waiting to depart from a single departure runway.},

Security is beginning to receive increased attention and not only within the military/security industry, but also within the civilian sector. Security is a chain with many weak links. The dynamics of security are crucial: compliance erodes, vulnerabilities develop, risk perceptions change and misperceptions fool people. The recent years have seen a strong emphasis on technical security measures. However, the interplay of human behaviour, organisational aspects and technology is an important enabler for security and represents a socio-technical system that must be addressed in an appropriate manner. The ultimate goal of security is to reduce the impact of security threats and vulnerabilities to an organisation's strategic objectives. In other words, security needs to be managed with a view to establishing a resilient system/organisation.},

  abstract = {The long-term reliability and functioning of transportation systems will increasingly need to consider and plan for climate change and extreme weather events. Transportation systems have largely been designed and operated for historical climate conditions that are now often exceeded. Emerging knowledge of how to plan for climate change largely embraces risk-based thinking favoring more robust infrastructure designs. However, there remain questions about whether this approach is sufficient given the uncertainty and non-stationarity of the climate, and many other driving factors affecting transportation systems (e.g., funding, rapid technological change, population and utilization shifts, etc.). This paper examines existing research and knowledge related to the vulnerability of the transportation system to climate change and extreme weather events and finds that there are both direct and indirect ``pathways of disruption.'' Direct pathways of disruption consist of both abrupt impacts to physical infrastructure and impacts via non-physical factors such as human health, behavior, and decision making. Similarly, indirect pathways of disruption result from interconnections with other critical infrastructure and social systems. Currently, the direct pathways appear to receive much of the focus in vulnerability and risk assessments, and the predominant approach for addressing these pathways of disruption emphasizes strengthening and armoring infrastructure (robustness) guided by risk analysis. However, our analysis reveals that indirect pathways of disruption can have meaningful impacts, while also being less amenable to robustness-based approaches. As a result, we posit that concepts like flexibility and agility appear to be well suited to complement the status quo of robustness by addressing the indirect and non-physical pathways of disruption that often prove challenging - thereby improving the resilience of transportation systems.},

Very often, these publications are all that is visible of this lengthy process, and even then, most of our journal articles are only accessible to scholars at institutions paying subscription fees to the journal publishers. While this traditional model of the archaeological research process has long been effective at generating new knowledge about our past, it is increasingly at odds with current norms of practice in other sciences. Often described as `open science', these new norms include data stewardship instead of data ownership, transparency in the analysis process instead of secrecy, and public involvement instead of exclusion. While the concept of open science is not new in archaeology (e.g., see Lake 2012 and other papers in that volume), a less transparent model often prevails, unfortunately. We believe that there is much to be gained, both for individual researchers and for the discipline, from broader application of open science practices. In this article, we very briefly describe these practices and their benefits to researchers. We introduce the Society of American Archaeology's Open Science Interest Group (OSIG) as a community to help archaeologists engage in and benefit from open science practices, and describe how it will facilitate the adoption of open science in archaeology.

The combined data is analyzed using computational intelligence and data analytics to determine suitable course of action while utilizing historically learnt knowledge and performing live learning from the current situation. Such framework is expected to be useful in diverse weather conditions and shall be a useful architecture to provide autonomy to maritime vessels.},

It is shown how the formalism realizes many of the important elements of Bratman's theory of intention. In particular, the notion of intention developed here has equal status with the notions of belief and desire.},

  abstract = {Economic prosperity brings greater demand for travel. As people get wealthier, they can afford to travel further and more often. In the case of aviation this trend has been amplified by technological advances, cost efficiencies and strengthened competition within the industry, which have brought air travel within the reach of many million people. In an era of increasing globalization, foreign travel - whether for pleasure or on business - is now a common experience. The increasing affordability of air travel has opened up new destinations and possibilities. Further, it has also expanded people's horizons, opportunities and expectations. As a result, air travel has shown a three-fold increase over the last 30 years. The availability of sufficient airport capacity is an important constraint on future growth. However, even at current levels of use, many airports in the U.S., Europe and few airports in Asia Pacific are becoming increasingly congested as they attempt to cope with rising passenger numbers. In some cases, the capacity of terminals and runways is at, or near, saturation point.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a review, classification schemes, critique, a simple meta-analysis and future research implication of fuel consumption optimization (FCO) literature in the air transport sector. This review is based on 277 articles published in various publication outlets between 1973 and 2014. A review of 277 articles related to the FCO in air transport was carried out. It provides an academic database of literature between the periods of 1973\textendash{} 2014 covering 69 journals and proposes a classification scheme to classify the articles. Twelve hundred of articles were identified and reviewed for their direct relevance to the FCO in air transport. Two hundred seventy seven articles were subsequently selected, reviewed and classified. Each of the 277 selected articles was categorized on four FCO dimensions (Aircraft technology \& design, aviation operations \& infrastructure, socioeconomic \& policy measures, and alternate fuels \& fuel properties). The articles were further classified into six categories of FCO research methodologies (analytical - conceptual, mathematical, statistical, and empirical- experimental, statistical, and case studies) and optimization techniques (linear programming, mixed integer programming, dynamic programming, gradient based algorithms, simulation modeling, and nature based algorithms). In addition, a simple meta-analysis was also carried out to enhance understanding of the development and evolution of research in the FCO. This has resulted in the identification of 277 articles from 69 journals by year of publication, journal, and topic area based on the two classification schemes related to FCO research, published between, 1973 to December- 2014. In addition, the study has identified the 4 dimensions and 98 decision variables affecting the fuel consumption. Also, this study has explained the six categories of FCO research methodologies (analytical - conceptual, mathematical, statistical, and empirical-experimental, statistical, and case studies) and optimization techniques (linear programming, mixed integer programming, dynamic programming, gradient based algorithms, simulation modeling, and nature based algorithms). The findings of this study indicate that the analytical-mathematical research methodologies represent the 47 \% of FCO research. The results show that there is an increasing trend in research of the FCO. It is observed that the number of published articles between the period 1973 and 2000 is less (90 articles), so we can say that there are 187 articles which appeared in various journals and other publication sources in the area of FCO since 2000. Furthermore there is increased trend in research on FCO from 2000 onward. This is due to the fact that continuously new researchers are commencing their research activities in FCO research. This shows clearly that FCO research is a current research area among many research groups across the world. Lastly, the prices of jet fuel have significantly increased since the 2005. The aviation sector's fuel efficiency improvements have slowed down since the 1970s\textendash 1980s due to the slower pace of technological development in engine and aerodynamic designs and airframe materials. We conclude that FCO models need to address the composite fuel consumption problem by extending models to include all the dimensions, i.e. aircraft technology \& design, aviation operations \& infrastructure, socioeconomic \& policy measures, and alternative fuels \& fuel properties. FCO models typically comprise all the four dimensions and this reality need to be taken into account in global FCO models. In addition, these models should have objectives or constraints to evaluate the aircraft sizes according to market structure, impact of various policy measures on fuel burn, and near term potential alternative fuel options in the global FCO problem. In the models reviewed, we evaluated that, only the few authors considered these factors. The literature identifies 98 decision variables affecting the fuel consumption related to various dimensions in air transport. So we can conclude that this analysis could represent the informational framework for FCO research in air transport. Our analysis provides a roadmap to guide future research and facilitate knowledge accumulation and creation concerning the application of optimization techniques in fuel consumption of air transport. The addressed dimensions \& decision variables could be of potential value to future researchers on the aviation fuel consumption optimization research and is also capable of further refinements. In future, for fuel consumption optimization the explored decision variables could be checked for their reliability and validity and a statistically significant model with minimum number of decision variable could be developed. Further, on the basis of this statistical significant model and with the best market requirement for transport aircraft, the researchers can frame the objective function for fuel consumption minimization problem \& decide their dependent variables, independent variables, constant, and constraints. Furthermore, this study will also provide the base for fuel conservation, energy efficiency, and emission reduction in the aviation sector.},

  abstract = {An important question in forecasting air traffic at airports is: How does the future traffic volume compare with capacity? We concentrate in this paper on air transport movements (ATMs) and runway capacity, since in many instances runways form the most critical airport component for expansion, due to environmental constraints. Air traffic forecasts like those of aircraft manufacturers typically yield annual volumes, whereas capacities are correctly measured in short time periods, i.e. hours. In answering the question of the conformity of demand (in this case ATMs) with capacity, future annual volumes have to be converted into peak hour volumes and then compared with capacity. The paper discusses the problem of selecting a suitable peak hour and informs on the annual capacity utilisation of airports worldwide in the form of ``traffic ranking curves''. Functional relationships between peak hour and annual ATM volumes have been derived for each type of airport capacity.},
